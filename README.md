### Used main components to develop this system:
- CYMA Glock 18C (CM.030)
- ESP32 (WROOM)

It should also fit into other softair guns from the manufacturer cyma, as the internals are probably pretty much the same by mechanical design. Also feel free to use any other microcontroller instead of the ESP32 (as long as it fits into the housing, of course).
